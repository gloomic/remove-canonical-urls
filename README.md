# Remove Canonical URLs

A plugin which removes the canonical URLs generated by WordPress and/or Yoast SEO.

## What does it for?

The plugin makes WordPress and/or Yoast SEO (It's fine if you do not use Yoast SEO) not put a canonical tag in the head of a post/page.
Bing may refuse to index a page that has a canonical URL pointing to itself because it considers the page as a duplicated one.
